In this project i built a model to determine whether the email is spam or not.
I first transform the upper letters to lower,  removed special characters and stop words,
lemmatized the word to return it to its origin,
used Keras tokenizer to transform the words to vectors,
And finally, I used NLTK model to determine if it's negative or positive feedback.
